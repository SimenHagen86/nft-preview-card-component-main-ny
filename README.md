## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

What i learned from this is that i cant rely just on watching tutorials.
i see that this is really simple for many, but in my case
i used alot of time trying to get ::before on an image to get the previw - till i watch a bunch of Kevin Powell videos on YT,
finding out that its not possible to get it on image. scrapped the first try i had with just pictures and no anchor tags.

struggled abit with the preview icon and background.
But not giviing up this yet - feel like with all the struggeling on this "easy" task i learned a ton!

### Continued development

try to get better as a whole, need to get better at naming convension and sematics.
hoping for constructive feedback,
watched other solutions and i see i have alot to learn...

### Useful resources

Kevin Powell yt ( watched 25+ videos in two days),
watching other people soulutions.attribution
