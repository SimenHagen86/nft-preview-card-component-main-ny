## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

What i learned from this is that i cant rely just on watching tutorials.
i see that this is really simple for many, but in my case
i used alot of time trying to get ::before on an image to get the previw - till i watch a bunch of Kevin Powell videos on YT,
finding out that its not possible to get it on image. scrapped the first try i had with just pictures and no anchor tags.

struggled abit with the preview icon and background.
But not giviing up this yet - feel like with all the struggeling on this "easy" task i learned a ton!

### Continued development

try to get better as a whole, need to get better at naming convension and sematics.
hoping for constructive feedback,
watched other solutions and i see i have alot to learn...

### Useful resources

Kevin Powell yt ( watched 25+ videos in two days),
watching other people soulutions.attribution
